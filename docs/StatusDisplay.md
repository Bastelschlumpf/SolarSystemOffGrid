### Monitor description

![Circuit](../images/M5PaperMarkup.png "M5Paper")

The entire solar system should have a display on which all important status messages and values are visible.  
In addition, two diagrams about the power curve should be displayed.  
By simple symbols it should be directly recognizable in which direction the power is currently flowing and  
whether a connection is switched on or off.  
If errors occur in the battery monitor module or the charge controller,  
these should be displayed with priority.
Furthermore, it should be visible if the data is no longer supplied by the IoBroker or if it is outdated.  

Here is the description of each area.
